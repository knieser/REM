# REMFA (Robust Expectation-Maximization for Factor Analysis)

This repository contains code for the REMFA (REM for Factor Analysis) R package. REM is a robust expectation-maximization algorithm presented in [Addressing Heterogeneous Populations in Latent Variable Settings through Robust Estimation](https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000413 "https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000413").

This R package is not yet available to download from CRAN, but you can access the package by cloning this repository to your local machine and loading it using the load_all() function from devtools.

``` r
library(devtools)
load_all()
```
